# Multi-Source Loan Risk Analytics Dashboard

This project is a modular, expandable analytics dashboard designed to evaluate loan risk across multiple U.S. lending datasets using **Python, pandas, and Streamlit**. The platform integrates public and synthetic data to generate cleaned outputs, visual dashboards, and risk insights.

>  Each module supports a separate dataset with tailored cleaning and analysis
>  Final outputs are integrated into a unified Streamlit dashboard with multipage navigation

---

## What This Project Does

* Cleans, standardizes, and models data from various loan-related datasets
* Creates binary and categorical risk outcomes
* Outputs consistent files for modeling, reporting, and visualization
* Enables dashboard navigation across multiple loan sources (LendingClub, Fannie Mae, SBA, PPP, Synthetic)

## How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy streamlit
```

### 2. Download and unzip applicable datasets:

* LendingClub Loan Data (2007â€“2018): [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club)

Place files in `data/`, then run the corresponding cleaning scripts.

### 3. Run a cleaning script

```bash
python lendingclub_clean.py
```

### 4. Launch the Streamlit dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Planned Enhancements

* [ ] Add secure user authentication to the Streamlit app (basic email + password login)
* [ ] Enable multi-page navigation to segment dashboards by dataset (LendingClub, Fannie Mae, SBA, etc.)
* [ ] Integrate multiple charts and metrics per dataset for comparative risk analysis
* [ ] Include markdown sections to explain each datasetâ€™s context, assumptions, and insights
* [ ] Add functionality for users to download cleaned data per module
* [ ] Optional: Link APIs for live refresh (e.g., SBA, USASpending)
